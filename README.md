# Murat GÃ¶zel
Hi there,

My name is Murat. I'm an independent software developer and designer. Here at Github, I maintain my open source works and run some private projects.

I might have few things to write this public profile. Let's start with the **tech stacks** I used so far:
- 6 years: nginx + node.js + docker + postgresql + redis + react, svelte 
- 8 years: apache + php + mysql + jquery
- 2 years: Adobe Dreamweaver + ActionScript (Flash)

And I'm a designer as much as I'm a developer:
- Sketch, Figma, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop

The following services are doing their job great and they absolutely deserve a **mention** here:
- [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com) for running my wild CI/CD workflows
- [Logto](https://github.com/logto-io/logto) for authentication and authorization
- WebStorm and Datagrip are excellent tools that I can't live without while building things
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) and AWS SES for transactional emails.
- [Infisical](https://infisical.com) for secret management.
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org) for product analytics.

I'm old enough to set some **principles** for myself:
- I avoid workng with big tech giants as much as possible.
- Learn what's new and stay customer optimized.
- Infrastructure comes first to create maintainable and reliable products.
- My frontend products are compatible with modern browsers, IE 10 and IE 11.

Thanks for reading.
