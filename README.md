# Murat GÃ¶zel
Hi there,

My name is Murat. I'm an independent, senior-level software developer specialized in creating accessible, beautiful and robust software products. My portfolio contains various kind of applications including frontend, backend, bot, iOS and CLI apps. I worked with B2B companies closely for most of my career and has been in different kind of digital communities.

It's been more than ten years I have been building custom software and making infrastructural decisions, therefore yes, I have a few open-source projects that I built completely with the intention of helping young fellows. You will find some below.

## Tech Stack
My tech stack contains technologies both in programming and design. These are the technologies I trust most and can recommend.
- My primary programming language is javascript with typescript and I'm able to code in python, solidity, swift and shell as well.
- eslint and prettier to keep my codebases clean and standard.
- vitest for testing.
- Conventional commits, commitlint, [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com) and shell scripts to run CI/CD workflows.
- Svelte as a frontend framework including SSG.
- Tailwind for styling.
- Fastify as backend server framework.
- Redis for in-memory storage.
- PostgreSQL as a database and DataGrip as GUI.
- [Logto](https://github.com/logto-io/logto) for authentication.
- Docker for containerizing my backend apps.
- WebStorm as a code editor.
- Xcode for iOS apps.
- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) to design user interfaces and other things.
- Adobe Illustrator for print design.
- Digitalocean for cloud servers.
- AWS S3 for various storage needs.
- [Infisical](https://infisical.com) for secret management.
- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) and AWS SES for transactional email.
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org) for analytics.

## Principles
- I avoid workng with big tech giants as much as possible.
- Learn what's new and stay customer optimized.
- Infrastructure comes first to create maintainable and reliable products.
- My frontend products are compatible with modern browsers, IE 10 and IE 11.
