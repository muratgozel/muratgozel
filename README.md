Hi there,

My name is Murat. I'm an independent, senior-level software developer who makes custom software including but not limited to web-based frontend and backend products, bots, iOS apps and CLI apps. I have custom shell scripts to deploy my apps and using CI/CD platforms as well.

I open source things I believe missing and potentially help others in the language's ecosystem. My open-source work also signals my portfolio as I'm not able to share all of my work publicly.

## Tech Stack
You will find the programming languages, frameworks and libraries I prefer to use below. The list is not complete but hope that it gives an idea about my technical routines.
### Javascript
- Typescript
- eslint to keep the codebase aligned with [standard javascript code style](https://github.com/standard/standard).
- Localization libraries based on formatjs.
- jest for testing.
### Frontend
All of my frontend products compatible with modern browsers + IE 10 and IE 11. [See the full list of compatible browsers](https://browserslist.dev/?q=ZGVmYXVsdHMsID4gMC4xJSwgaWUgMTAgYW5kIG5vdCBpZSA5).
- Svelte as a frontend framework.
- React as a frontend framework but less than Svelte.
- Tailwind for styling.
- CSS pre-processors such as SASS and Stylus.
- Vite to create SSR enabled production builds.
- prosemirror to create custom text editors.
### Backend
- node.js
- Fastify as server framework.
- redis for in-memory storage.
- PostgreSQL and slonik as a database client.
- ajv to validate schemas.
- Logto for authentication.
- pino for logging.
### Desktop
- **Xcode** for iOS apps and **WebStorm** for all the other apps
- **Postico** to design and manage PostgreSQL databases.
- Built-in **Terminal** in MacOS.
- **Docker** for containerized deployments.
### Cloud Services
- Digitalocean servers.
- AWS SES, S3 and Cloudfront.
- Heroku.
- Sentry.
- Plausible.
- Google Analytics.
### Other Programming Languages
- Python. I use Python as neccessary depending on the project.
- Solidity. As closely working with web3 communities, I have a few smart contracts built in Solidity.
- Swift. I build iOS apps by using Swift and SwiftUI.
- Shell. I use shell to make custom deployment scripts.
